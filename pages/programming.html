      <p>Szallós Kis Csaba (1998) is a software developer with an appetite for natural language processing, machine learning and data visualization.</p>
      <p>He also writes <a id="poetref" href="../pages/poetry.html">poems</a> in Hungarian.</p>
    
      <h3 class="subtitle">Bio</h3>

      <p>studied <b>computer science</b> as BSc at the <b>Babeș-Bolyai University</b> between 2017 and 2020, among algorithms, data structures, grahps, linux, assembly, haskell, databases, c, c++, java, statistics, machine learning, algebra, networking, etc. the most valuable assets learned here were probably critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
      <p>studied <b>data analysis and modelling</b> as MSc at the <b>Babeș-Bolyai University</b> between 2020 and 2022 because the subjects I enjoyed mostly during the first three years of university were natural language processing and machine learning, and here besides analyzing and visualizing data the main focus was machine learning, but we also learned GPGPU programming and swarm intelligence.</p>

      <p>working as a <b>C++ software developer</b> at <b>Ringo Tech</b> since 2019.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Projects</h3>
      <p><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/arcplot" target="_blank">arcplot</a></b> - a published Python library based on matplotlib for seamless creation of custom arc diagrams.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://gitlab.com/szkics/visualhaikus" target="_blank">visual haikus</a></b> - a Python application which writes haikus based on images. the goal of my license thesis: creating a program which writes a poem in the form of haiku from a landscape, a painting, a sketch, or any visual input. thus the program would 'behave' as a poet, it would create art from a source of inspiration. built ML model and attempted to find a possible generative grammar for haikus. technically speaking: a multi-label image recognition in Keras combined with dependency parsing of different texts with spaCy.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://github.com/szkics/onrepeatify" target="_blank">onrepeatify</a></b> - a Python application for
        automatically adding songs from automaticvally generated 'On Repeat' Spotify playlist into a 'favorites' playlist
        collecting the all time favorites.</p>
      <p><b><a href="../map/map_of_extinct_and_endangered_languages.html" target="_blank">interactive map of extinct and endangered languages</a></b> - a webpage which displays extinct and endangered languages all around the world. based on the Leaflet framework the goal was to create a data visualization which can help users navigate easily while exploring languages. by clicking on their names, the appropriate wikipedia article will pop up for a more in-depth understanding.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/spellcheckmate" target="_blank">spellcheckmate</a></b> - a hopefully cross-platform reimplementation of Peter Norvig's spelling corrector with minor modifications.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://gitlab.com/szkics/geometric-tunes" target="_blank">geometric tunes</a></b> - interactive new media installation written in python which was showcased at Clujotronic electro arts festival deployed on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/15591034/" target="_blank">interactive visualization of the best movies based on letterboxd</a></b> - using Flourish to represent the top 250 narrative feature films based on letterboxd.</p>
      <p><b><a href="../rhythm/rhythm.html" target="_blank">rhythm</a></b> - metric foot transcription applicable to Hungarian poetry initially written in java and afterwards in javascript.</p>
      <p><b>Braille OCR</b> - a cross-platform application which can identify Braille-characters written by a Braille-typewriter. in order to assist the educational process for the visually impaired, the aim of my dissertation thesis is to develop a smartphone application which monitors a mechanical Braille typewriter and recognizes the Braille-characters in real time. my main focus: creating the ML model which performs OCR on a video recorded by a smartphone in real-time.</p>
