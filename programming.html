    <p>Szallós Kis Csaba (1998) is a software developer with an appetite for natural language processing, machine learning and data visualisation.</p>
    <p>He also writes <a id="poetref" href="poetry.html">poems</a> in Hungarian.</p>
  
    <h3 class="subtitle">Bio</h3>

    <p>studied <b>computer science</b> as BSc at the <b>Babeș-Bolyai University</b> between 2017 and 2020, among algorithms, data structures, grahps, linux, assembly, haskell, databases, c, c++, java, statistics, machine learning, algebra, networking, etc. the most valuable assets learned here were probably critical thinking and problem solving.
    <p>studied <b>data analysis and modelling</b> as MSc at the <b>Babeș-Bolyai University</b> between 2020 and 2022 because the subjects I enjoyed mostly during the first three years of university were natural language processing and machine learning, and here besides analyzing and visualising data the main focus was machine learning, but we also learned GPGPU programming and swarm intelligence.</p>

    <p>working as a <b>C++ software developer</b> at <b>Ringo Tech</b> since 2019.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Projects</h3>

    <p><b><a href="https://gitlab.com/szkics/visualhaikus" target="_blank">visual haikus</a></b> - an application which writes haikus based on images. my license thesis, a multi-label image recognition written in python.</p>
    <p><b><a href="map_of_extinct_and_endangered_languages.html" target="_blank">interactive map of extinct and endangered languages</a></b> - a webpage which displays extinct and endangered languages all around the world. based on the Leaflet framework the goal was to create a data visualisation which can help users navigate easily while exploring languages. by clicking on their names, the appropriate wikipedia article will pop up for a more in-depth understanding.</p>
    <p><b><a href="https://gitlab.com/szkics/geometric-tunes" target="_blank">geometric tunes</a></b> - interactive new media installation written in python which was showcased at Clujotronic electro arts festival deployed on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p><b><a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/15591034/" target="_blank">interactive visualisation of the best movies based on letterboxd</a></b> - using Flourish to represent the top 250 narrative feature films based on letterboxd.</p>
    <p><b><a href="rhythm.html" target="_blank">rhythm</a></b> - metric foot transcription applicable to Hungarian poetry initially written in java and afterwards in javascript.</p>
    <p><b>Braille OCR</b> - an application which can identify Braille-characters written by a Braille-typewriter. my masters thesis, where the model was built using python and used in Xamarin.Forms using the EmguCV dotnet framework.</p>
    <p><b>next words of poets</b> - a next word predicton project which predicts next words of beat icon, Allen Ginsberg and my favourite Hungarian poets, Pilinszky János and József Attila. Built LSTM model and experimented on both English and Hungarian corpus. GUI written in Streamlit.</p>
    <p><b>multilingual text summarization web application</b> - Django-based text summarization tool that allows users to input long articles or documents, and the application generates concise summaries. You can use extractive or abstractive summarization techniques and integrate popular NLP libraries like spaCy or GPT-based models for better results.</p>
    <p><b>interactive word cloud generator</b> - Develop a tool that generates interactive word clouds based on the frequency of words in a given text, allowing users to explore and analyze.</p>
    <p><b>phylogenetic tree generator</b> - Develop a basic tool for generating phylogenetic trees from user-provided DNA or protein sequences using simple algorithms.</p>
